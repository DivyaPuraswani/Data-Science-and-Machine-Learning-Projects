#Logistic regression classification techniques are used to predict certain useful insights from the data.

-Project 1 deals with 'titanic' dataset from kaggle in which predictions are made to find the class of survival of individual : survived
or deceaved. This includes some exploratory data analysis and then instantiating an object of linear_regression model and using the 
predict method for further predictions.

-Project 2 handles the dataset 'advertising' to predict whether an individual will click on an ad or not based on the features of the user 
and their previous activities online.
